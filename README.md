Hi Professor Rivas, I got really confused with the portion of our assignment where we had to save our work as an sql file. I realized that I didn't have all my queries, insert, and create table statments 
all in one spot. I would execute them then clear the query screen to move onto the next task. I did not realize that this was the case until I had restarted my pgAdmin 4 and all my older queries were wiped. I 
was able to replicate everything besides the insertion statements but I have my actual data still in my server along with screenshots of my work in the assignment doc.
