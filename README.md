Lab 2: Hi Professor Rivas, I got really confused with the portion of our assignment where we had to save our work as an sql file. I realized that I didn't have all my queries, insert, and create table statments 
all in one spot. I would execute them then clear the query screen to move onto the next task. I did not realize that this was the case until I had restarted my pgAdmin 4 and all my older queries were wiped. I 
was able to replicate everything besides the insertion statements but I have my actual data still in my server along with screenshots of my work in the assignment doc. 


Lab 3: I had the Club Scenario: I had the basic student and club entities with simple attributes for both and I had a join table for them in the form of the enrollment relationship which stored their role and join date. These also used the primary keys of the two entities as foreign and primary keys. I also had the meeting entity which stored the information of a club's meeting, this used the primary key of club as a foreign and primary key. To run it, you should just be able to copy and paste it.
